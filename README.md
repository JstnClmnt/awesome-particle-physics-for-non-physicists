# awesome-physics-for-non-physicists [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated list of introductory resources to particle physics for people without a background in physics

## Awesome list criteria

1. The list includes videos (preferred), slides, notes, and other materials.
2. Ensure that the links to videos, talks, and slides are publicly accessible.
3. Add a descriptive title for the link, and place it under the appropriate category.
4. For multiple related resources that may not necessarily link to each other, please add all the links separately in a part-by-part order.
5. If you are unable to categorise the resources, please leave them under [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)
4. Adding resources on advanced subjects is encouraged, but do ensure the other resources present on the list cover the prerequisites for such topics - feel free to add those yourself.

## Miscellaneous

For more resources on particle physics as well as deep learning with a focus on physics, look up the resources available on the [CERN Document Server](http://cds.cern.ch/).

Helpful Tip for Beginners: Refer to [Academic Training](http://cds.cern.ch/collection/Academic%20Training%20Lectures?ln=en) or [Summer Student Lectures](http://cds.cern.ch/collection/Summer%20Student%20Lectures?ln=en) since they assume very little pre-existing knowledge.
