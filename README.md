# awesome-particle-physics-for-non-physicists [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
[Particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter and radiation. Although the word "particle" can refer to various types of very small objects, "particle physics" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the fundamental interactions necessary to explain their behaviour.

This is a curated list of **introductory** resources to fundamental concepts in particle physics including the Standard Model, QED, QCD, Jets, Colliders, and Detectors. The idea is to learn these concepts with no background knowledge necessary (for the most part)!

## Awesome list criteria

1. The list includes videos (preferred), slides, notes, and other materials.
2. Ensure that the links to videos, talks, and slides are publicly accessible.
3. Add a descriptive title for the link, and place it under the appropriate category.
4. For multiple related resources that may not necessarily link to each other, please add all the links separately in a part-by-part order.
5. If you are unable to categorise the resources, please leave them under [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous--advanced)
4. Adding resources on advanced subjects is encouraged, but do ensure the other resources present on the list cover the prerequisites for such topics - feel free to add those yourself.
5. Please add a :warning: warning against all advanced/theoretical resources for easier browsing.

## Need More?
* For more resources on particle physics as well as deep learning with a focus on physics, look up the resources available on the [CERN Document Server](http://cds.cern.ch/).

* Also for more blog posts, check out this blog - [Of Particular Significance](https://profmattstrassler.com/new-start-here/) - by [Prof. Matt Strassler](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~strassler/).

#### :bulb: Helpful Tip for Beginners: 
* Refer to [Academic Training](http://cds.cern.ch/collection/Academic%20Training%20Lectures?ln=en) or [Summer Student Lectures](http://cds.cern.ch/collection/Summer%20Student%20Lectures?ln=en) since they assume very little pre-existing knowledge.

* Try reading up a few articles on [Prof. Strassler's Blog](https://profmattstrassler.com/about/about-this-site-and-how-to-use-it/) before/after watching video lectures - this approach seems to be pretty helpful in nailing down most concepts.
